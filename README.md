# Wayne's TicTacToe


Plain text just gets imported as part of the paragraph

Having a line break `from the above text` will create a seperate paragraph otherwise it will all sit on the same line

## Heading 2
### Heading 3

- List item 1 - this is how to create a ul list
- List item 2
- List item 3

1. Item 1 - This is how to create an ol list
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

```Javascript
for (let block of blocks) {
    block.addEventListner('click, handleClick, {once: true}');
}
```
can do the same as above for HTML and CSS
